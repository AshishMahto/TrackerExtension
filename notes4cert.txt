This extension's functionality is very limited. The only thing it does is affect some calculations that the external Tracker.gg website makes.

The existing functionality on Tracker.gg:
1. Visit https://tracker.gg/valorant/profile/riot/100T%20Asuna%231111/matches?playlist=competitive
2. Note that on the left sidebar, Activity is for "Last 60 days."
3. Changing the selected Act to "All Acts" on the top right tab selection buttons will not affect the "Last 60 days" calculation.

The existing behaviour on Tracker.gg may be interpreted as a bug by the end user.
One might expect that the Activity should reflect the selected Act.
In fact, this functionality does exist, but only when selected Acts that are even older than the current one.
For example:
4. Changing the selected Act to "E7: A1" on the tab selection will change it so Activity is for "E7: A1 only."

This "bug" is what this extension aims to fix.

Extended functionality by enabling this extension:
1. Visit https://tracker.gg/valorant/profile/riot/100T%20Asuna%231111/matches?playlist=competitive
2. Note that on the left sidebar, Activity is for "E7: A2 only." (the numbers will change over time, but will reflect the tab selection exactly.)
3. Changing the selected Act to "All Acts" on the top right tab selection buttons will change it so Activity is for "Last 60 days.", the original behaviour.
4. Changing the selected Act to "E7: A1" on the tab selection will change it so Activity is for "E7: A1 only."
